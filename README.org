#+TITLE: My .emacs.d

Yes, it's a poor man's Emacs configuration.

- usable configuration on front-end development (react, typescript; eslint, prettier)
- dired-mode works well
- great git experience (thanks, magit, the best git interface in the world!)
- flyspell for spell checking
- elfeed as RSS reader

* Requirements

- coreutils for better dired experience
- hunspell for flyspell

* TODOs

- no-littering
- more language configurations
- lsp
- more on counsel
- use persp-mode better
