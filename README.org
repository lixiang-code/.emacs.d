#+TITLE: My .emacs.d

Yes, it's a poor man's Emacs configuration.

* Hightlight

- usable configuration on front-end development (react, typescript and eslint)
- dired-mode works well on both macOS and Windows
- flyspell for spell checking
- elfeed as RSS reader

* TODOs

- more packages on git
- treemacs?
- more language configurations
- lsp
- tabs?
