#+TITLE: My .emacs.d

Yes, it's a poor man's Emacs configuration.

- usable front-end develop experience (react, typescript; eslint, prettier)
- dired-mode works well
- great git experience (thanks, magit, the best git interface in the world!)
- flyspell for spell checking
- elfeed as RSS reader

* Requirements

- ~coreutils~ for better dired experience
- ~hunspell~ for flyspell
- LSPs
  + ~tsserver~ (from TypeScript, used in Tide)
  + ~vscode-css-languageserver-bin~ (for CSS)
* TODOs

- no-littering
- more language configurations
- more yas-snippets
